# Instructions
Problem 1:
Declare two variables, "x" and "y", and assign them numerical values. Use the modulus operator to calculate the remainder when "x" is divided by "y". Print the result.

Problem 2:
Declare a variable called "name" and assign it a string value of your choice. Print the value of the variable to the console.

Problem 3:
Declare two variables, "num1" and "num2", and assign them any numerical values. Calculate the sum of the two variables and store the result in a new variable called "sum". Print the value of the "sum" variable.

Problem 4:
Declare a variable called "radius" and assign it a numerical value. Calculate the area of a circle using the formula A = Ï€r^2 and store the result in a variable called "area". Print the value of the "area" variable.

Problem 5:
Declare a variable called "num" and assign it a numerical value. Increment the value of "num" by 5 and print the updated value.
